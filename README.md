# Data Collection
I scraped the data using the GitHub API to search for users in Stockholm with more than 100 followers. Each user's information and their repositories were retrieved in a structured format for analysis via python.

# Interesting Findings
One surprising fact was that many users actively contribute to repositories in diverse programming languages, showcasing a vibrant tech community in Stockholm.

# Recommendation
Developers should network with users who have a high follower count and active repositories, as they are likely to have valuable insights and opportunities for collaboration.
